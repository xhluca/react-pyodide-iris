# Getting started with pyodide in React

This repository shows how to classify Iris using scikit-learn directly inside your react app (all happening client-side). It was created using [`react-pyodide-template`](https://github.com/xhlulu/react-pyodide-template).

The app will take one minute to load the first time since it is downloading large files through the network.



## Quickstart

To get started, simply run the lines below in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/xhlulu/react-pyodide-iris.git
cd react-pyodide-iris
npm i
npm start
```

When you are ready, you can serve the production build:
```
npm i -g serve
serve -s build
```
